# lightning-lottery-backend
Backend for a lottery to win Amazon vouchers.

Project for the Lightning hackday 31/8/2018

For the wiki, see https://wiki.fulmo.org/index.php?title=Lightning_Lottery

This repository is for the backend code: communication with LND and storing of participants.
I plan on implementing this in Go.
